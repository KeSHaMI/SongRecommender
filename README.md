# SongRecommender
Bot containing text for 270 000 songs and simple recommendation system

Made this bot as my pet project. And as for me this recommendations make sense(that was surprise for me) and I can explain why songs are in recommendations, so this approach probably makes sense!

First goal was to implement recommendation system in some product and I've decided to use telebot for UI
Second goal is to develop this project further(add all songs, and build RNN to analyze text currently using Tf-Idf vectorizing) because I want to give recommendations based purely on lyrics(I pay more attention to this) without taking into a—Åcount genre singer is associated with. 

Also having idea to build recommendation based purely on sound, but cuurently I have poor timeseries analysis skills, beacause I've finished some courses but haven't used acquired knowledge in practice, so it would be one of my next steps in my professional development
